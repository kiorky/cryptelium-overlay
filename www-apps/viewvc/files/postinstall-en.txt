If you are using Apache, consider adding something like this to your
apache.conf:

ScriptAlias /viewvc ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/${PN}/viewvc.cgi
ScriptAlias /query ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/${PN}/query.cgi

Before using viewcvs, be sure to configure it properly.
Edit ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/viewcvs.conf and ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/cvsgraph.conf to
suit your needs.
